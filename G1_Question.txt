Ch. 2
======
What is timeseries data?
Should all the prior observation be treated equally?
What is concept drift?
How important is the order (in time dimension)? Does it have strong role to play in prediction?
Can we do prediction without really doing the analysis?
Components of timeseries data (4 Components describe completeness? or Anything else possible?) 

ch. 3
=====
supervised learning: Y = f(x)
a) classification : Output is a category/bucket
b) Regression: Output is real value /

Lag/sliding window method to convert any timeseries into a supervised learning problem.
Can be used to solve both univariate (single variable observed in each time point) and multivariate problems(2 or more variables observed in each time point).

One-step forecast vs multistep forecast (extension to the one-step forecast? if not whats the diff.?)
